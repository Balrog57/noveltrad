LLM-specific exceptions.

class ContextOverflowError(Exception):
    """
    Raised when the input text exceeds the model's context window.

    This typically occurs when a chunk is too large for the model to process
    in a single request.
    """

class RepetitionLoopError(Exception):
    """
    Raised when the model enters a repetition loop.

    This can occur with "thinking" models that get stuck repeating the same
    phrase or pattern, indicating the model has likely exceeded its effective
    context window or encountered an issue.
    """

class RateLimitError(Exception):
    """
    Raised when the API returns HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) and all retry
    attempts with backoff have been exhausted.

    This signals the translation pipeline to auto-pause and save a checkpoint
    so the user can resume later.

    Attributes:
        retry_after: Suggested wait time in seconds (from Retry-After header),
                     or None if not provided by the API.
        provider: Name of the LLM provider that was rate-limited.
        partial_result: Best-effort, already-reassembled payload carrying the
                        work completed before the rate limit hit, so the caller
                        can persist it instead of discarding it. Its type is
                        defined by whoever raises (or re-raises) the error;
                        None when the raiser has nothing to hand over.
