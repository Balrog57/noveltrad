"""
Build the glossary block to inject into the system prompt.

The block style mirrors the existing prompt voice in src/prompts/prompts.py
(numbered priorities, MANDATORY phrasing) so the LLM treats glossary entries
with the same weight as the rest of the instructions.

Two blocks live here:

- ``build_glossary_block`` renders the terms that match the current chunk.
- ``build_cast_block`` renders every gendered entity in the glossary,
  regardless of the current chunk. Gender is the one piece of glossary data
  that is needed precisely when the term is *absent*: in languages that omit
  the subject or do not mark gender (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Turkish,
  Finnish), a passage can be full of pronouns without naming anyone, and a
  chunk-filtered glossary says nothing there. That is exactly where a model
  falls back to masculine for everyone.

# inflect the ending": that narrower licence is false for several of the gated
# languages (Turkish kitap->kitabı, Finnish katu->kadun, Russian отец->отца,

            hint; the authoritative gender instruction lives in the cast block
            built by ``build_cast_block``.
