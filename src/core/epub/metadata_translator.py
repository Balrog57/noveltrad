"""
Packaging-metadata localization for translated EPUBs.

The pipeline translates every content document but leaves the *packaging* in the
source language: `content.opf` keeps its original `dc:title` and
`dc:description`, and `toc.ncx` keeps its original `docTitle/text`. A reader's
library shelf, its "book information" panel and most file managers read exactly
those fields, so a fully translated book still shows up under its Chinese title
(finding F5 of `plan/PLAN_CjkSourceRendering.md`).

This module owns that fix, and nothing else:
  - `translate_opf_metadata(...)` — one LLM call for both fields, in-place edit
    of the OPF tree, its own OPF write, then propagation of the accepted title
    to every `*.ncx` `docTitle/text`.

Deliberate design constraints, all from the plan:
  - **One call per book.** Both fields travel in a single request; there is no
    retry, no correction pass and no fallback provider. A rejected result keeps
    the original value, which is always a valid EPUB.
  - **`dc:creator` is never touched.** Author names are neither translated nor
    transliterated.
  - **Never fails the job.** Every failure mode (no response, unparseable
    response, a raising client, a broken NCX) is logged and swallowed; the
    caller's EPUB is written either way.
  - **The client is the caller's.** `llm_client` / `model_name` are the ones
    `translate_epub_file` already built; this module creates no client, reads no
    provider setting and needs no API key of its own.
