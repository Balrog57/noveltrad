"""
F6 detection test (plan/PLAN_CjkSourceRendering.md, Phase 7, §1.4): translate a
fixture with a stubbed LLM that returns each chunk verbatim, and assert the
output `<p>` count equals the input `<p>` count.

Purpose and limits. With a verbatim echo stub the reassembly must reproduce
every paragraph exactly, so this test makes any *future* reassembly-side
paragraph loss a hard failure. It does NOT attempt to fix the LLM-side merging
of very short lines observed in the real run (5 paragraphs lost across 28
chapters, ~0.2% -- see §1.4 of the plan): that loss happens because a real
model sometimes folds a very short source line into a neighboring one, which
cannot be reproduced by an echo stub that never rewrites anything, and fixing
it would be speculative.

Two paths are covered:

  - The default (placeholder) path. This is a genuine PASS: an empty `<p></p>`
    (a common spacer/formatting block) reduces to a zero-character
    placeholder-only chunk, which Phase 1's `is_text_free_chunk` guard passes
    through verbatim instead of sending it to the LLM, so the tag survives
    untouched. Verified empirically, not assumed.

  - Plain Text Mode (`prompt_options={'plain_text_mode': True}`). This used to
    reproduce a REAL reassembly-side loss with the verbatim stub, and was pinned
    here as a strict xfail: an empty `<p></p>` is extracted as the same kind of
    block as any other paragraph, is skipped when segments are built (nothing to
    send to the LLM), and comes back as an empty string;
    `replace_body_with_paragraphs` then did `if text:` before emitting the block,
    so the empty paragraph was silently dropped from the rebuilt body -- one
    `<p>` fewer in the output than in the input, deterministically, with no LLM
    behaviour involved. That is the mechanism Phase 2 named in
    plan/PLAN_CjkSourceRendering.md §5.1 ("F2 and F6 have the same origin").
    **Fixed** in `replace_body_with_paragraphs`
    (src/core/epub/plain_extractor.py): an empty translation now falls back to
    the source text, and when both are empty an empty block is emitted, so no
    paragraph is ever deleted. The test below is therefore a normal passing
    test guarding that fix. See
    `tests/unit/epub/test_issue_207_content_loss.py` (section D) for the
    unit-level coverage of the same two guards.
